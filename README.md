#Explorer (Giant Killer Robot Mark-2) 

This is the project holding a Java controller program which checks all USB 
channels to see if the are active, i.e. have a serial communication port active
and can start a communications chat on that channel and a set of C++ programs 
which are examples of comms programs with different types of sensors (mostly from
Adafruit industries) to show a POC to get data from sensors and then transmit and 
concentrate it via a USB bus to a controller program before disemination to other
controllers (nano/micro services) to handle the actions which should be associated
with these sensor readings.

the code is for pluming into a larger progect and may be part of a revamp of the 
Giant Killer Robot Mk-1 code.
